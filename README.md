# Project Guidance
Keep:

* a timelog, updated regularly in the `timelog.md` format;
* all source under version control;
* data well organised and with appropriate ethical approval (for human subject data);

Here's an overview of the structure as it stands:

* `timelog.md` The time log for your project.
* `plan.md` A skeleton week-by-week plan for the project. 
* `data/` data you acquire during the project
* `src/` source code for your project
* `status_report/` the status report submitted in December
* `meetings/` Records of the meetings you have during the project.
* `dissertation/` source and for your project dissertation
* `presentation/` your presentation

* Make sure you add a `.gitignore` or similar for your VCS for the tools you are using!
* Add any appropriate continuous integration (e.g. Travis CI) in this directory.!

## Important
* It should be easy to rebuild and run your project and your dissertation
        * Include clear instructions in the relevant directories to make this possible
